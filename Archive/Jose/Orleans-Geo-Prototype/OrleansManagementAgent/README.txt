Marlowe Management Events and Agents for Orleans
================================================

This project links to and depends on the Marlowe ManagementFramework libraries.

The original TFS depot location for the Marlowe binaries is:
    $/Data Center Futures/DatacenterControl/ManagementFramework/Binaries
or build drop location:
    \\Ccfbuild1\drops\DataCenterControl\ManagementFramework\Latest\Debug

For dependency control, a copy of the above TFS location has been branched into:
    $/Data Center Futures/Orleans/Code/Prototype/OrleansV4/Dependencies/Marlowe-ManagementFramework
All references from Orleans code / projects should point to this location.


In order to run these Agents, the Marlowe prerequisites will need to be installed on your machine 
-- specifically WspEventRouter from:
	\\Ccfbuild1\drops\DataCenterControl\Dependencies\x64 prereqs
or
	\\Ccfbuild1\drops\DataCenterControl\Dependencies\x86 prereqs
