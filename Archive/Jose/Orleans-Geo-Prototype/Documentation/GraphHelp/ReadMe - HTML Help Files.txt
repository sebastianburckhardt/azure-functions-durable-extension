The HTML Help files are not included in the Dev Main build for efficiency.

They can be found in the last SDK Drop, or be generated locally using the Sandcastle Help File Builder, detailed in the 

	"...\Prototype\OrleansV4\Checklists for Building Help.one" OneNote section.

The latest versions of these files should be checked in to SDK branches before the final release build is made.
