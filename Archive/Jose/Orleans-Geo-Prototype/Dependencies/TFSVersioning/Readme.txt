This is a hacky little command line utility to get Versioning working in TFS.

The command line usage is:

TFSVersioning.exe <Path of Build-Version.txt File> <Path of Version.txt File> <Path of GlobalAssemblyInfo.cs file> <TFS Build Number>


Source code for this program is in the Orleans TFS depot: [DCF]\Orleans\Code\Main\BuildTools\TFSVersioning
